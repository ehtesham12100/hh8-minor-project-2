Project Description
Weak passwords are one of the major causes of security breaches. Many users reuse simple or predictable passwords, making systems vulnerable to attacks. This project analyzes a user-entered password and evaluates its strength using multiple security rules.

The tool checks:
- Password length
- Presence of uppercase letters
- Presence of lowercase letters
- Presence of digits
- Presence of special characters

Based on these checks, the system classifies the password as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**.
